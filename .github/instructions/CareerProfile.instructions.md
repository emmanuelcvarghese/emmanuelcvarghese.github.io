### **Objective**
Revamp my personal portfolio website, hosted on GitHub Pages, to better reflect my professional profile as a Data Scientist and Developer. The goal is to create a modern, clean, and professional site that effectively showcases my skills, experience, and projects to potential employers and collaborators, drawing inspiration from the provided reference image.

### **Inputs**
1.  **Current Codebase:** The entire current project directory.
2.  **Inspiration Image:** `Rference style.png`. Use this for aesthetic inspiration, focusing on layout, color, and typography. The final design must be unique and tailored to a data science professional.
3.  **Content Source:** My LinkedIn profile: `https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmanuelvarghese/`.

### **Key Requirements**

**1. Content Integration:**
*   Analyze my LinkedIn profile to extract and integrate the following into the website:
    *   **Summary/About Me:** A concise professional bio.
    *   **Work Experience:** A detailed timeline of job titles, companies, dates, and key responsibilities/achievements.
    *   **Projects:** A curated list of key projects with descriptions.
    *   **Skills:** A categorized list of technical skills (e.g., Programming Languages, Frameworks, Tools).
    *   **Education:** Degrees, universities, and dates.

**2. Design and Layout:**
*   **Site Structure:** Propose a new site structure with the following sections:
    *   **Hero/Home:** A compelling introduction with my name, title, and links to my GitHub and LinkedIn.
    *   **About Me:** A more detailed bio.
    *   **Experience:** A timeline of my professional roles.
    *   **Projects:** A card-based gallery to showcase my work, with links to live demos or code repositories.
    *   **Skills:** A visually appealing display of my technical skills.
    *   **Contact:** A simple contact form or links to my professional profiles.
*   **Aesthetics (Inspired by the reference image):**
    *   **Color Palette:** Implement a modern, dark-themed design.
        *   **Background:** A deep, near-black color (e.g., `#111111`).
        *   **Primary Text:** Off-white or light gray for readability (e.g., `#F5F5F5`).
        *   **Accent Colors:** Use a vibrant gradient (e.g., transitioning from a bright yellow to a deep purple) for key visual elements, inspired by the circle in the image. A secondary, muted accent color (like the soft violet from the "Trustpilot" lozenge) can be used for secondary highlights or tags.
    *   **Typography:**
        *   **Headings:** Use a sophisticated serif font for main headings to create a strong focal point (similar to "Manage Your Effective Plans").
        *   **Body & UI:** Use a clean, readable sans-serif font for body text, navigation, and other UI elements.
    *   **Layout:** Employ an asymmetrical layout with generous use of white space to create a clean, uncluttered feel. Use layered elements (e.g., cards slightly overlapping the hero image) to add depth and visual interest.

**3. Technical Implementation:**
*   Analyze the existing codebase to determine the current technology stack.
*   Provide the necessary code changes (HTML, CSS, and any JavaScript) to implement the new design and structure.
*   Ensure the website is fully responsive, providing an excellent experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

### **Action Plan**
Please proceed in the following order:
1.  First, outline the proposed new site structure and the content you'll pull from my LinkedIn for each section.
2.  Next, suggest a specific color palette and font pairing based on the detailed requirements above.
3.  Finally, provide the code modifications to implement the new hero section as a starting point.
